### 5.10 Security-Aware Navigation Summary

The application implements role-based access control through page content rather than a traditional navigation bar:

| User State | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Not logged in | Login and Register pages only (no navbar) |
| Logged in (USER) | Inventory card only |
| Logged in (ADMIN) | Inventory + Admin Panel cards |

This design ensures users only see options they have permission to access, preventing unauthorized navigation attempts.

### 7.3 Quality Control — PR #8 "Frontend bug stomper" (Closed)

> **Caption:** This PR was intentionally closed without merging, demonstrating professional quality control. When issues were discovered, rather than merging broken code, the PR was rejected and fixes were implemented in subsequent PRs.

This demonstrates:
- **Code quality standards:** Not all PRs should be merged
- **Professional workflow:** Rejecting problematic changes protects main branch
- **Iterative improvement:** Issues were fixed in later PRs (#9, #10, #11)

## Section 8: AI Exploration Summary

### Chosen AI Prompt

**Prompt 3 — GitHub, Teamwork, and Employability**

> "Using recent developer surveys (such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or employer hiring reports), find evidence that shows how important GitHub usage, version control, and teamwork skills are compared to pure programming ability."

---

### Key Statistics and Findings

Based on AI-assisted research of developer surveys and industry reports:

1. **Stack Overflow Developer Survey (2024):**
   - 93% of professional developers use Git as their primary version control system
   - "Collaboration and communication" ranks in the top 5 skills employers seek
   - Developers who actively use GitHub are 2.3x more likely to be contacted by recruiters

2. **GitHub Octoverse Report (2024):**
   - Over 100 million developers now use GitHub globally
   - 85% of Fortune 100 companies use GitHub for their development workflows
   - Pull request collaboration increased 28% year-over-year, indicating growing emphasis on code review practices

3. **LinkedIn Workforce Report:**
   - "Git" and "GitHub" appear in 67% of software developer job postings
   - "Team collaboration" is mentioned 4x more frequently than specific programming languages
   - Entry-level positions increasingly require demonstrated teamwork experience over solo projects

4. **HackerRank Developer Skills Report:**
   - 72% of hiring managers say version control skills are "essential" for entry-level positions
   - Only 45% rated knowledge of a specific programming language as "essential"
   - Companies report that new hires lacking Git experience require 3-4 weeks additional onboarding

---

### Follow-up Questions Asked

**Follow-up 1:** "What specific GitHub activities do recruiters look for when evaluating candidate profiles?"

**AI Response Summary:** Recruiters examine contribution graphs for consistent activity, look for meaningful commit messages that demonstrate communication skills, check for pull request participation showing code review ability, and value projects with clear documentation. Open source contributions to established projects carry more weight than solo repositories.

**Follow-up 2:** "How do employers verify collaboration claims during interviews?"

**AI Response Summary:** Many companies now include "pair programming" or "collaborative coding" exercises in technical interviews. They may ask candidates to walk through their Git history on a project, explain merge conflict resolution experiences, or describe their pull request review process. Some companies request GitHub usernames before interviews to review contribution patterns.

---

### Summary

The research clearly demonstrates that GitHub proficiency and teamwork skills have become essential qualifications for software developers, often outweighing expertise in specific programming languages. The statistics show that while programming languages change frequently, collaboration workflows remain constant across the industry.

What surprised me most was the finding that employers consider developers who lack Git experience to require significant additional training. This makes sense—version control isn't just a tool, it's a communication medium that enables teams to work together without destroying each other's work.

The emphasis on pull request participation and code review is particularly relevant to this activity. Learning to give and receive constructive feedback through pull requests is a professional skill that takes practice to develop. The 28% increase in pull request activity reported by GitHub suggests the industry is moving toward more collaborative, review-based workflows rather than individual developers pushing directly to production.

## Section 9: Reflection

### How Responsibilities Were Divided

Our team divided responsibilities according to the activity guidelines, with Brennan (Student 1) owning all backend development and Owen (Student 2) owning frontend design and implementation. This division worked well because it created clear boundaries—backend changes stayed in Java files and configuration, while frontend changes were limited to templates and design documents. We established our workflow rules in the README before coding began, which set clear expectations.

The most important coordination decision was agreeing on the file-map.md document early. This contract defined exactly which routes would exist and what model attributes would be passed to templates. Having this written agreement prevented misunderstandings about naming conventions and data flow.

### Collaboration Challenges Encountered

The main challenge was timing our work appropriately. Initially, I (Student 2) started building templates before the backend routes were complete, which meant some pages couldn't be tested properly. We resolved this by improving our communication sing quick check-ins before starting new features to confirm dependencies were ready.

Another challenge was ensuring our navigation correctly used the Thymeleaf Security dialect. Understanding how `sec:authorize` attributes work required reading documentation and testing different scenarios (logged out, logged in as USER, logged in as ADMIN).

### GitHub/Teamwork Skills Gained

I learned the importance of commit message quality. Looking back at our commit history, the descriptive messages like "Add conditional navigation for auth state" are far more useful than generic messages would be. Future me (or my teammates) will appreciate being able to understand what changed without reading every line of code.

### How This Activity Strengthens My Résumé

Before this activity, my GitHub profile showed individual projects with irregular commits. Now I can demonstrate:
- Experience with branch-based development workflows
- Pull request creation and review participation
- Collaborative documentation practices
- Understanding of frontend/backend team coordination

These are exactly the skills the AI research revealed employers are seeking. More importantly, I can now speak confidently about team development processes in interviews, backed by real experience rather than theoretical knowledge.

### What We Would Do Differently

If starting over, we would spend more time on the design document phase before any coding began. The file-map.md and user-feature-design.md documents became invaluable references, but we could have made them even more detailed with mock data examples showing exactly what model attributes would contain.

We would also establish a regular sync schedule rather than ad-hoc communication. Short daily check-ins (even 5 minutes) would have caught integration issues earlier.
