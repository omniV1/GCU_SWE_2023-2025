# SummerPractice

Self-directed practice and skill refreshers across multiple languages and frameworks, including exploratory projects and technology experiments.

## What's here
- `AerospaceAPI/`: .NET Web API project with aerospace/aviation theme
- `C#/`: C# console applications and small projects
- `Java/`: Java practice exercises and OOP examples
- `TypeScript/`: TypeScript fundamentals and small applications

## Focus areas
- **API development**: REST endpoints, JSON serialization, HTTP status codes
- **Language fundamentals**: syntax review, OOP principles, data structures
- **Modern tooling**: package managers, build systems, IDE configuration
- **Cross-language patterns**: comparing implementation approaches across C#, Java, TypeScript

## How to run
- **AerospaceAPI**: Open solution in Visual Studio, configure any connection strings, F5 to run
- **C# projects**: `dotnet run` from project folders
- **Java**: Compile with `javac` and run with `java`, or import into IDE
- **TypeScript**: `npm install && npm start` or `tsc && node dist/...`

## Purpose
Maintaining and expanding technical skills through independent exploration and cross-language practice during academic breaks.
