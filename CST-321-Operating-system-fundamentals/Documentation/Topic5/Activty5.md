# Northbridge and Southbridge in Computer Architecture

## Research

### What are these bridges and what functions do they perform?

#### Northbridge:
The Northbridge is a chip on a computer's motherboard responsible for communications between the CPU, memory, and, in some cases, the graphics hardware. It is typically faster than the Southbridge and handles tasks that require higher performance.

**Functions of Northbridge:**
- Connects the CPU to high-speed devices.
- Manages communications with the system's RAM.
- In many systems, it also connects to the PCI Express slots, providing a pathway to the graphics card.

#### Southbridge:
The Southbridge is another chip on the motherboard that manages the input/output functions of the computer. It typically handles slower data connections.

**Functions of Southbridge:**
- Manages onboard hardware such as the audio and network controllers, USB, Serial ATA, and IDE storage ports.
- Handles system BIOS, power management, and hardware monitoring.
- Provides connectivity to external peripheral devices.

### Why are there 2 bridges?

Having two separate bridges allows for efficient handling of different types of data traffic. The Northbridge deals with high-speed, high-bandwidth operations, while the Southbridge takes care of the slower and more peripheral communications. This separation helps in balancing the data flow within the computer, leading to better performance.

### What I/O devices are handled in each bridge?

**Northbridge:**
- Main memory (RAM)
- High-speed graphics card (via PCI Express)

**Southbridge:**
- USB ports
- Onboard audio and network adapters
- Hard drives and SSDs (via SATA and IDE ports)
- Legacy ports such as serial and parallel ports

### Where do components like a DMA controller fit into the bridges?

A Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller typically connects through the Southbridge. It allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory independently of the central processing unit (CPU), which can offload work from the CPU for I/O operations.

### How are devices like a keyboard, mouse, network, and hard disk handled?

- **Keyboard and Mouse:** Usually connected via USB, which is handled by the Southbridge.
- **Network:** Network interfaces connect through the Southbridge, via integrated network controllers.
- **Hard Disk:** Managed by the Southbridge through SATA or IDE connectors.

## Conclusion

The Northbridge and Southbridge are fundamental to a computer's architecture, providing a means to efficiently handle communications between the CPU and various I/O devices. Understanding these components allows for a deeper comprehension of how modern computers manage complex data flows and peripheral interactions.

# Bash Shell Scripting - If, Loop, and Reading Files

## Basha.sh output:



## Operation

1. **Start**: The user invokes the script from the command line, providing a numeric argument. For example, `./basha.sh 25`.

2. **Input Processing**: The script takes the first argument provided by the user (`$1`) and compares it to the number 50 using conditional statements.

3. **Condition Check**: There are three conditions the script checks for:
    - If the argument is less than 50 (`-lt`).
    - If the argument is equal to 50 (`-eq`).
    - If the argument is greater than 50 (all other cases not caught by the first two conditions).

4. **Output**:
    - If the number is less than 50, the script outputs: `"The number is less than 50."`
    - If the number is equal to 50, the script outputs: `"The number is equal to 50."`
    - If the number is greater than 50, the script outputs: `"The number is greater than 50."`

## Bashb.sh output:


## Operation

1. **Start**: Execution begins when the user runs the script from the command line.

2. **Loop Initialization**: The script initializes a `for` loop with a sequence generated by brace expansion `{1..10}`, which produces a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

3. **Iteration and Output**:
    - For each iteration of the loop, the variable `i` takes on the value of the current number in the sequence.
    - The script then executes the `echo` command to print a message to the terminal in the format `"Number $i"`, where `$i` is the current number of the iteration.
    - This process repeats for each number in the sequence from 1 to 10.

4. **Completion**: Once all numbers in the sequence have been printed, the loop terminates, and the script ends its execution.

## Bashc.sh output:


## Operation

1. **Start**: Execution begins when the script is invoked from the command line while in the desired directory.

2. **Listing Files**: The script executes the `ls` command within a subshell `$(ls)`, capturing the output, which is a list of all files and directories in the current working directory.

3. **Iteration**:
    - The `for` loop iterates over each entry returned by the `ls` command.
    - For each iteration, the variable `file` is assigned the name of the current file or directory from the list.

4. **Output**: Inside the loop, the script uses the `echo` command to print the name of the current file or directory to the terminal, prefixed with "File: " to clearly indicate each entry is a file or directory name.

5. **Completion**: After processing all entries returned by the `ls` command, the loop concludes, and the script ends its execution.
## Bashd.sh outputs


## Operation

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes a variable named `counter` with the value of 1. This variable is used to track the current number being processed and displayed.

2. **Condition Check**: Before each iteration of the `while` loop, the script checks if the `counter` variable's value is less than or equal to 10. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.

3. **Execution and Increment**:
    - **Execution**: Inside the loop, the script executes the `echo` command to print the current value of `counter` to the terminal, prefixed with the word "Number".
    - **Increment**: After printing, the script increments the value of `counter` by 1 using the `((counter++))` syntax. This prepares `counter` for the next iteration's condition check.

4. **Loop Termination**: Once `counter` exceeds 10, the condition for the `while` loop evaluates to false, causing the loop to terminate.

5. **Completion**: With the loop terminated, the script ends its execution.

## Bashe.sh output:

## Operation:


1. **Argument Validation**: Initially, the script checks if the number of arguments (`$#`) is less than 2. If this condition is true, it prints a usage message indicating how to run the script correctly and exits with a status of 1. This ensures that the user provides both the filename and the name to search for.

2. **Variable Assignment**: If the correct number of arguments is provided, the script assigns them to variables for easier reference:
    - `filename` is assigned the first argument (`$1`), representing the name of the file containing the list of names.
    - `name_to_search` is assigned the second argument (`$2`), representing the specific name the user wants to find within the file.

3. **Initialization**: The script initializes a variable `found` to 0, which will later be used as a flag to indicate whether the specified name has been found in the file.

4. **Sorting and Printing**: The script then prints a header message indicating it will list sorted names from the provided filename. It reads each name from the file after sorting (using `sort $filename`) through process substitution. This method allows for reading sorted content line by line without creating a subshell, ensuring variable modifications persist outside of the loop.

5. **Search**: As it prints each name, the script checks if the current name matches `name_to_search`. If a match is found, it sets `found` to 1 and exits the loop early with a `break` statement, optimizing the script by avoiding unnecessary comparisons after the desired name is found.

6. **Result**: After exiting the loop, the script checks the `found` flag. If `found` equals 1, it prints a message indicating that the name was found in the file. Otherwise, it prints a message stating the name was not found.

# DMA Controller and Bus Speed Analysis

## Question A: Bus Speed for DMA Controller

**Given**:
- DMA controller has 5 channels.
- Can request a 32-bit word every 40 ns.
- Response time is 40 ns.

**Calculation**:
- Each channel can request a 32-bit word every 40 ns, so the transfer time for one word is 80 ns (40 ns for request and 40 ns for response).
- Since there are 5 channels, the total number of bits transferred every 80 ns is:
  `5 channels * 32 bits/channel = 160 bits`
- To avoid being a bottleneck, the bus speed (in bits per second) must be:
  `160 bits / 80 ns = 2 bits/ns = 2 * 10^9 bits/s = 2 Gbps`

**Justification**:
The bus must handle the combined throughput of all DMA channels to avoid bottlenecks. Given the need for a 32-bit transfer every 80 ns per channel, a minimum bus speed of 2 Gbps is required to support simultaneous data transfer across all channels without delay.

## Question B: Screen Rewrite Time Calculations

**Text Mode Screen**:
- 80 characters/line * 25 lines = 2000 characters
- Each character is typically 1 byte in text mode.
- Total time to rewrite the screen is `2000 bytes * 2 ns/byte = 4000 ns = 4 μs`

**Graphics Screen**:
- Resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels, 24-bit color (3 bytes/pixel).
- Total pixels = `1024 pixels * 768 pixels = 786432 pixels`
- Total bytes = `786432 pixels * 3 bytes/pixel = 2359296 bytes`
- Total time to rewrite the screen is `2359296 bytes * 2 ns/byte = 4718592 ns ≈ 4.72 ms`

**Justification**:
In text mode, the rewrite is swift due to the smaller data size. In contrast, a high-resolution graphics screen with deep color requires significantly more data to be copied. Despite the same per-byte time, the graphics screen's large number of bytes means the operation takes around 4.72 ms to complete a full screen rewrite.
