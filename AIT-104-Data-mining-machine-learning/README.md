# AIT-104 — Data Mining & Machine Learning (Python)

This folder contains introductory ML and data analysis work in Python, focusing on pandas, exploratory data analysis, and basic linear modeling.

## What’s here
- `Code Projects/`: Jupyter notebooks with hands-on exercises (e.g., Linear Modeling Part One).
- `Data/`: Small CSV datasets used by notebooks (e.g., `AAPL.csv`, `PLTR.csv`).
- `Notes/`: Weekly notebooks and notes.
- `Python_pandas_machine_learning/`: Topic notes (markdown) covering pandas, ML concepts, and study materials.

## Key concepts
- **Pandas fundamentals**: DataFrames, Series, indexing, filtering, groupby operations
- **Data cleaning**: handling missing values, outliers, data type conversions
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: descriptive statistics, histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices
- **Machine learning basics**: train/test splits, feature selection, model evaluation metrics (R², RMSE)
- **Linear regression**: simple/multiple regression, coefficient interpretation, residual analysis
- **Jupyter workflows**: reproducible analysis, markdown documentation, visualization integration

## How to run
- Prereqs: Python 3.10+ and Jupyter
- Install: `pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`
- Start: `jupyter notebook` and open notebooks in `Code Projects/` or `Notes/`
- Datasets: CSVs are in `Data/` (paths in notebooks assume relative access)

## Highlights
- Linear Modeling Part One: end-to-end small regression workflow
- Curated study notes in `Python_pandas_machine_learning/`
