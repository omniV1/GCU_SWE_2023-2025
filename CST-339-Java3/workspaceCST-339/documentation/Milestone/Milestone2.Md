## Domain Overview

The Airport Gate Management System (AGMS) addresses the complex challenges faced by modern airports in managing their gate assignments and flight operations. Currently, many airports rely on manual processes or outdated systems that don't provide real-time updates, leading to inefficiencies in gate utilization and potential delays in flight operations. Our system aims to streamline these operations through an intuitive, web-based interface that provides real-time management of gates, flights, and resources.

## User Stories and Requirements

### Public/Customer Access

As an airline passenger or airport visitor, I need to quickly find my flight and gate information to ensure I arrive at the right location on time:

"I need to easily look up my flight by flight number or destination to find the correct terminal and gate. I should be able to see real-time updates about my flight's status, gate changes, and boarding times. The information should be clear and accessible from both mobile and desktop devices, with the option to receive notifications about changes affecting my flight."

***Key Requirements:***
- Simple, intuitive flight search
- Clear gate and terminal information
- Real-time flight status updates
- Gate location wayfinding
- Boarding time information
- Gate change notifications
- ADA-compliant interface

This public interface will be separate from the administrative system but will consume data from the same backend services. The focus is on providing clear, accurate information without the complexity of the full management system.

### Airport Operations Staff

As an airport operations manager, I need to efficiently manage gate assignments so that I can maximize airport resource utilization and minimize delays. This includes:

"I need to see a real-time dashboard of all gate assignments and their current status. When a flight is delayed, I need to be able to quickly identify available gates and reassign flights to minimize disruption to the overall schedule. The system should automatically check for conflicts and alert me before I make an invalid assignment."

***Key Requirements:***
- Real-time visibility of gate status
- Drag-and-drop interface for quick reassignments
- Automatic conflict detection
- Historical assignment data for planning

### Gate Managers

As a gate manager, I need to monitor and update the status of gates under my responsibility to ensure smooth operations. Their story:

"I need to be able to quickly mark gates as available, occupied, or under maintenance. When maintenance is scheduled, I need to block out that time in advance so no flights get assigned to that gate. I also need to record any issues or special conditions that might affect gate usage."

***Key Requirements:***
- Quick status updates
- Maintenance scheduling
- Issue reporting
- Gate history tracking

### Airline Staff

As an airline staff member, I need to view gate assignments for my airline's flights and request changes when necessary:

"I need to see all upcoming gate assignments for my airline's flights. When operational requirements change, I need to be able to request gate reassignments and receive quick approval or denial from airport operations. I also need to be notified immediately of any changes affecting our flights."

***Key Requirements:***
- Airline-specific view of assignments
- Gate change request system
- Real-time notifications
- Historical data access

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model Description
Our system's data model handles the relationships between flights, gates, and assignments in a straightforward way that keeps data accurate and easy to query. Here are the main components:

### User 
The User keeps track of who can access the system and what they can do. It stores each user's unique ID, login credentials, and what roles they have in the system. It also records when user accounts were created and last updated, and keeps track of their login sessions for security.

### Flight 
The Flight stores all the key information about each flight. This includes the flight number and airline code, when the flight is scheduled to arrive and depart, what type of aircraft is being used, and how big it is. It tracks the flight's current status, any delays, and keeps a history of which gates it has been assigned to.

### Gate 
The Gate manages information about each physical gate at the airport. Each gate has its own ID and location within a specific terminal. The system knows which types and sizes of aircraft can use each gate, whether the gate is currently available, and keeps records of past and scheduled maintenance.

### Assignment 
The Assignment connects flights to gates. It records the time period a gate is assigned to a flight, tracks the status of that assignment, and checks for any scheduling conflicts. Each assignment record shows who created it and when it was last changed, helping us track how gates are being used.

## System Architecture and Design

### Class Diagram (UML)
The following class diagram illustrates the core components of the system and their relationships:

### Business Logic Layer

The business layer implements rules for gate assignments, including:

Aircraft Compatibility Verification:
```java
public interface GateCompatibilityService {
    /**
     * Verifies if a gate can accommodate a specific aircraft type
     * considering physical dimensions and service requirements.
     *
     * @param gate The gate to verify
     * @param aircraftType The type of aircraft to check
     * @return A compatibility result with details
     */
    CompatibilityResult verifyCompatibility(Gate gate, AircraftType aircraftType);
}
```

Conflict Detection:
```java
public interface ConflictDetectionService {
    /**
     * Analyzes potential conflicts for a proposed gate assignment
     * considering existing assignments and maintenance schedules.
     *
     * @param proposedAssignment The assignment to verify
     * @return List of detected conflicts with details
     */
    List<Conflict> detectConflicts(Assignment proposedAssignment);
}
```

### Overview
The interface design will focus on three core areas, each serving distinct user needs and workflows:

## Interface Wireframes

### Public Interface Wireframes

#### Flight Search Interface
![Public Flight Search](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/publicUserPage.drawio(2).drawio.png)

The flight search interface prioritizes ease of use and intuitive flight information access for public users.

#### Gate Map Display
![Gate Map](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/GateMap.drawio.png)

The gate map provides a clear visual representation of all terminal gates and their current status.

#### Status Board
![Status Board](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/StatusBoard.drawio.png)

The status board presents real-time flight information in an easily scannable format.

### Administrative Interface Wireframes

#### Operations Dashboard
![Operations Dashboard](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/Operations%20dashboard.drawio(1).png)

The operations dashboard serves as the central control center for airport operations staff.

#### Gate Management Interface
![Gate Management](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/GateManagement.drawio.png)

The gate management interface provides comprehensive control over gate operations and maintenance.

#### Flight Management Interface
![Flight Management](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/FlightManagement.drawio.png)

The flight management interface enables detailed control over flight operations and assignments.

#### Reports Interface
![Operations Reports](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/OperationsReports.drawio.png)

The reports interface provides detailed analytics and performance metrics for system monitoring.

#### Authentication Interface
![User Authentication](https://github.com/omniV1/CST-339/blob/main/workspaceCST-339/documentation/Milestone/Screenshots/UserAuthdrawio.drawio(1).png)

The authentication interface ensures secure access to administrative functions.

Each interface maintains consistent design patterns including clear navigation, status indicators, and intuitive controls. The system uses color coding to indicate status:
- Green: Available/On Time
- Yellow: Warning/Potential Conflict
- Red: Unavailable/Critical Issue
- Blue: In Use/Normal Operation
