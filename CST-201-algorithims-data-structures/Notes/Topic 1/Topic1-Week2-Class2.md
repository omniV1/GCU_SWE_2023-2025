### Recursion

#### What is recursion and why use it? 
1. An algo that uses its self to solve a problem. 
2. Stack is in memory and used to solve the algo?
3. Blowing the stack is what will happen if the algo infinitely calls itself. 

### DFS
1. Depth first search
2. traverses all the way down and if it does not find the answer, it will move to the next available path up / down the tree. 
3. The knights tour is using recursion, it uses the knight piece to touch all parts of the board. 
4. Complete tour ends where you start
5. non complete tour does not end where we start.
