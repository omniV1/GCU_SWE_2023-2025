         An Instance
2. What are the two ways problems can be solved?
Exact and approx
example: 
integer math is exact / floating point math is approx
3. define GCD
   using Euclids algorithim
4. What is an algorithim
   an unmabigous set of steps
5. What is a consecuitive integer checking algorithim
   another algo to find GCD

# Types of problems

### Sorting algorithim

A way to organize items in acsending or descending order

A stable sort clarifies all items keep the same order

an Unstable sorting algorithim changes the order

an in place sort is sorted within the array which is likely a stable sort. 

an non in place sort is sorted outside of the array which is likely unstable stort. 

the two items that make up a graph are 
1. nodes
2. edges
represented by cartesian cordinates (x,y)
a graph using nodes and edges shows relational data
a graph using nodes shows data

Adjacent vertices are connected by an edge.

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

A subgraph is a graph within a graph, does not contain all the verticies. 

A path is the traversal of a graph, allows us to move from one point in a graph to another. 

A cycle when you leave one vertex and go clear back around to the same vertex. 

A Simple cycle is when you do not repeat edges or verticies. Except for the start / end. \

The length of a path / cycle is the number of edges we go through. 

An Acyclic graph is one with no cycles. 

A directed path can only go one direction.
