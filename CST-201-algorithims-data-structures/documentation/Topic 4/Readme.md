# Sorting Algorithm Analysis - Array Size 100, 100 Trials

## Overview
This analysis compares five sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and an Optimized Sort (hybrid of QuickSort and Insertion Sort). Each algorithm was tested with an array size of 100 over 100 trials.

## Performance Results
| Algorithm | Average Comparisons | Average Exchanges |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Selection Sort | 4,950 | 95.01 |
| Bubble Sort | 4,950 | 2,486.83 |
| Merge Sort | 541.16 | 672 |
| Quick Sort | 643 | 382.94 |
| Optimized Sort | 664.4 | 433.4 |

## Detailed Algorithm Analysis

| Algorithm | Description | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Use Case |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Selection Sort | Repeatedly finds minimum element from unsorted portion | Worst/Avg/Best: O(n²) | O(1) | Simple implementation, Minimal memory usage, Minimal swaps | Always O(n²) even if nearly sorted | Small arrays, Memory-constrained systems |
| Bubble Sort | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if in wrong order | Worst/Avg: O(n²), Best: O(n) | O(1) | Simple implementation, Best case O(n) | High number of exchanges, Poor performance on large arrays | Nearly sorted arrays, Educational purposes |
| Merge Sort | Divides array in half, sorts recursively, then merges | Worst/Avg/Best: O(n log n) | O(n) | Stable sort, Predictable performance | Requires extra space, More exchanges than Quick Sort | Large datasets, External sorting, When stability is required |
| Quick Sort | Selects pivot, partitions array, recursively sorts | Avg: O(n log n), Worst: O(n²) | O(log n) | Usually fastest in practice, In-place sorting | Worst case O(n²), Not stable | General purpose sorting, Large arrays |
| Optimized Sort | Hybrid of Quick Sort and Insertion Sort | Avg: O(n log n), Worst: O(n²) | O(log n) | Better handling of small subarrays, Good practical performance | Complex implementation, Still has O(n²) worst case | Production environments, Real-world data |

## Key Observations

1. **Comparison-Based Algorithms**
   - Selection and Bubble Sort both had 4,950 comparisons
   - Merge, Quick, and Optimized sorts had significantly fewer comparisons (500-700 range)
   - Demonstrates the efficiency difference between O(n²) and O(n log n) algorithms

2. **Exchange Operations**
   - Bubble Sort had highest exchange count (2,486.83)
   - Selection Sort had lowest exchange count (95.01)
   - Others showed moderate exchange counts (300-700 range)

3. **Efficiency Patterns**
   - O(n²) algorithms:
     * High comparison counts
     * Predictable but poor performance
   - O(n log n) algorithms:
     * Lower comparison counts
     * More efficient for larger datasets

4. **Trade-offs**
   - Simple algorithms (Selection, Bubble):
     * Easy to implement
     * Poor performance
   - Complex algorithms (Merge, Quick, Optimized):
     * Better performance
     * More complex implementation
     * Some require extra space

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**
   - In-place sorts: Selection, Bubble, Quick
   - Extra space required: Merge Sort (O(n))

2. **Stability**
   - Stable sorts: Bubble, Merge
   - Unstable sorts: Selection, Quick, Optimized

3. **Practical Applications**
   - Small arrays (<50 elements): Any algorithm acceptable
   - Medium arrays: Quick Sort or Optimized Sort recommended
   - Large arrays: Merge Sort or Quick Sort depending on stability requirements

## Recommendations

1. **For Small Arrays (<50 elements)**
   - Use simpler algorithms (Selection/Insertion Sort)
   - Implementation complexity outweighs performance benefits

2. **For Medium Arrays (50-1000 elements)**
   - Quick Sort or Optimized Sort
   - Good balance of performance and complexity

3. **For Large Arrays (>1000 elements)**
   - Merge Sort if stability is required
   - Quick Sort if stability is not important
   - Consider Optimized Sort for real-world data with patterns

4. **Special Considerations**
   - Memory-constrained: Selection or Quick Sort
   - Stable sorting needed: Merge Sort
   - Nearly sorted data: Bubble Sort
   - Random data: Quick Sort or Optimized Sort
