This program will simulate a modified war card game . War is a card game where a deck of cards is split between two players, each player has 26 cards from the deck. 
Each player turns over one card at a time, the player with the highest ranked card value wins the round. If the cards are equal the next card is turned over until there is a winner. 
The winner takes all the turned over cards. The goal is to "capture" all 52 cards of the deck.

There will be two simulated players each with an array of 26 integers. 
The values of these arrays will be initialized as two groups of 1–13. 
Both arrays will be shuffled. Starting at the top of the array, each player's integer will be selected and compared to the other player.

 The player with the largest number will win that round. The total number of rounds that each player wins will accumulate. After the 26 values have been played out, a deck will be completed. 
 The simulator will play 10 decks when the process is complete each player's statics will be output. These statics will include total wins for each player, total ties, and total win percentage for each player.
Program Requirements


1.    Two arrays of 26 items, one for each player. Two sets of values in each array from 1–13; shuffle arrays
2.    Draw top card from each array, us a standard compare function (return values 1, 0, or -1). Note: a match syntax can be used rather than if-else (this is not a requirement).
3.    Add outcome to proper total accumulator.
4.    Repeat previous step for a total of ten times.
5.    Output Statics: total wins for each player, total ties, and total win percentage for each player.
