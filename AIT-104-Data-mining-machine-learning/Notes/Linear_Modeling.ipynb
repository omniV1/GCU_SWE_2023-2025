    "# Introduction and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models help us to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. Linear models are foundational concepts and tools in machine learning, as they describe a response variable in terms of a linear combination of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
