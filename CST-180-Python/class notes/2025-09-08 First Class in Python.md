System requirements for classes: 

**Questions have arisen regarding the minimum configuration computers should have for class. The University Policy Handbook has information about CSET computer configurations. Pay particular attention to the sections for technology degrees. General minimum that I suggest is 32 GB RAM, 1 TB hard disk (NOT SSD), 5GHz CPU with 12 threads or more.**

this class wont use these requirements as much
