# CST-250 — Programming in C# II

Intermediate C# with OOP design, recursion, file I/O, and basic GUI programming.

## What’s here
- `Code/Activities/`:
  - `AnimalClasses/`: inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism
  - `ChessBoardConsoleApp/` and `ChessBoardGuiApp/`: move-generation and WinForms grid UI
  - `TextFileDataAccessDemo/`: file I/O (console and WinForms GUI)
  - `Activity3_Recursion/`: CountToOne, Factorial, GCD, Knight’s Tour
- `Code/Milestone/`: Minesweeper (console and WinForms GUI)
- `Documentation/`: screenshots and notes
- `Notes/`: arrays and course notes

## Key concepts
- **Object-oriented design**: inheritance hierarchies, abstract classes, interface implementation, polymorphism
- **Recursion patterns**: base cases, recursive calls, tail recursion, backtracking (Knight's Tour)
- **File I/O operations**: StreamReader/Writer, CSV parsing, exception handling, path management
- **WinForms development**: form design, event-driven programming, dynamic control generation, data binding
- **Algorithm implementation**: mathematical algorithms (GCD, factorial), game logic (Minesweeper flood fill)
- **Data structures**: 2D arrays, collections (List<T>), custom classes with properties

## Milestone — Minesweeper
- Features: randomized bombs, neighbor counts, flood fill reveal, flags, timer, high scores
- GUI path: `Code/Milestone/src/MinesweeperGui/MinesweeperGui`

## How to run
- Open solution files (`.sln`) in Visual Studio, build, and run
- For console apps, start with the project’s `Program.cs`

## Highlights
- Minesweeper GUI
- Chessboard move visualization and validation
- Recursion activity set
