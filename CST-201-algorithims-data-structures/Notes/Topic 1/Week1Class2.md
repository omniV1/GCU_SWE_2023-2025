### Two effiecencies to an alogrithim

1. Time
2. Space

### Other desirable characteristics

1.simplicity - easy to understand.
2. general - usable for every circumstance.
**we are not solving till infinity**

### is testing a science?

1. by the book no, it is an art.

- every sys has a range (low - high)
- out of bounds errors occur (low and high become non-applicable)

### most challenging aspect of an algorithim

- ***Optimization***

### Types of problems

1. Sorting - Organization of a collection of data in a sequential order.
2. Searching - needs to have a search criteria, and iterate through the data.

### what is a string

1. an array of ascii character
2. common behavior of strings are a comparison

### what is a graph

1. a collection of data points displayed in a cartesean coordinates.

### what is a geometric problem

1.

### what is a data structure

1. a way to organize data
50 - 90% of the lifetime of a program will be in maintenance

### example of linear data structure

1. a set array of data
2. data cannot be added or removed
3. advantage is quick to access

### what is needed to access a linear data structure

- an index

### what is a linked list?

1. needs a start defined (head pointer)
2. can change size (is very flexable)
3. slower access than linear data
4. adding a double linked list will get data faster

### what is a queue?

1. First in First out
2. when data enters it remains in that order
3. data can hang
4. ***priority queue*** : is not first in first out, possibility of data becoming higher priority thus leaving before other data that was entered earlier.

### what is a tree?

1. structured linked list with a parent node that points to children nodes.
2. trees do have a pointer to the parent meaning they are double linked traditionally.
3. Binary search tree is where the left side is the low side and the right side is the high side

  [ 50 ]
     |
    /\
 [10] [75]
  /\   /\
[] [] [] []

### What is an abstract data type

1. based on user definition.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes?

1. finds all prime numbers from 1 to infinity
2. works always to find a list of prime numbers
