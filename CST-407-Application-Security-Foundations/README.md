# CST-407 â€” Application Security Foundations

Secure coding practices, vulnerability analysis, cryptography, and application security testing across multiple languages and frameworks.

## What's here
- `Assignments/`: Security analysis, threat modeling, and secure coding exercises
- `coding/`: Java security implementations and examples
- `Class Notes/`: Lecture notes on security principles
- `imgs/`: Screenshots and security diagrams

## Major concepts
- **Secure coding practices**: input validation, output encoding, error handling
- **Common vulnerabilities**: OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, buffer overflows
- **Cryptography fundamentals**: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures
- **Authentication & authorization**: multi-factor auth, RBAC, OAuth, JWT
- **Security testing**: static analysis, dynamic testing, penetration testing basics
- **Threat modeling**: identifying attack vectors, risk assessment, mitigation strategies

## Tools and languages
- Java (primary development language)
- Security testing tools and static analyzers
- Cryptographic libraries and implementations

## Highlights
- Hands-on vulnerability assessment and remediation
- Implementation of secure authentication systems
- Cryptographic protocol analysis and implementation
