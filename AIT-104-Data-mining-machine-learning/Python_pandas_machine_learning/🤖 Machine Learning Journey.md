## 📝 Key Learning Notes

### From Aircraft Maintenance Experience

- **Systems Thinking**: Aircraft maintenance requires understanding complex interdependent systems - directly applicable to ML pipelines
- **Data Quality**: Critical measurements in aviation = critical data quality in ML
- **Troubleshooting**: Systematic debugging approach transfers to model debugging
- **Documentation**: Detailed maintenance logs = importance of experiment tracking

### Learning Strategy

- **Hands-on First**: Build intuition through practice before deep theory
- **Domain Application**: Always connect concepts back to aviation/real-world problems
- **Consistent Progress**: Daily learning habit, even if just 30 minutes
- **Document Everything**: This vault is the single source of truth for my ML journey
