# Decision Tree Model: 

This tree is split into two that contain different outcomes. 

A Decision tree is made with data from our database. The data says, splitting houses between two different outcomes will result in a particular price based on the amount of rooms. 

This step is called **Fitting** or **Training** the Model. The data used to fit the model is called **Training Data**

## Improving the Decision Tree

Which model in this photo makes more sense?

The first Decision Tree makes the most sense because more rooms naturally means higher cost.  The biggest issue with this model is that it relies only on room count instead of other factors like bathrooms, yard size, acreage. 

The more **splits** you create the more narrow the scope of the model becomes and as such the accuracy of the desired outcome increases.
